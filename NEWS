Changes in version 1.15:

The list command has been fixed to print a backslash before every '$'
character within the text. (Reported by Ori Avtalion).

Address ',,' has been fixed to mean '$,$' instead of '1,$'.
(Reported by Matthieu Felix).

A 's' command that is part of a 'g' or 'v' command-list can again split
a line by including a newline escaped with a backslash '\' in the
replacement string. For this to work, the closing delimiter of the
replacement string can't be omitted unless the 's' command is the last
command in the list, because otherwise the meaning of the escaped
newline would become ambiguous.

Following a recent change in the POSIX standard, the 'c' command no
longer accepts an address of 0, and the documentation for the 'i'
command now explains that it treats address 0 as meaning "at the
beginning of the buffer", instead of as a synonym for address 1.

Minor fixes have been made to the manual.

The configure script now accepts appending options to CFLAGS using the
syntax 'CFLAGS+=OPTIONS'.
